# Movie-Trailer-Program

This project is intended to be used within the Cassidy Lab (The Royal’s Institute of Mental Health Research, affiliated with uOttawa) for experiments conducted to study users interpretations of Movie Trailers.

This Python program was created by Dustin Doucette, a 4th year undergraduate Computer Science student at Carleton University.

## Installation

## Program Set-Up

Place pre-downloaded MP4 Movie Trailers into the folder `./Movie-Trailers`

## Program Use Instructions

1. Double click `Program.py` to start the program.

2. Click `Start` in the main menu to begin the experiment.

3. Enter your first and last name and press `Begin Testing`.

4. Select the movie trailer you wish to view from the available movie trailers, then select `Start Trailer`.

5. After the movie trailer has finished, close the video aplication and press `Continue` on the program window.

6. Select all of the relevant boxes (if the movie trailer had funny, scary and/or sexy content), then press `Next`.

7. Adjust the sliders to reflect your ratings (scale of 1-10), then press `Next`.

8. Select all of the relevant movie trailer frames which encompass the specified content. You will be given a new window for each box you selected in step 6 (if no boxes were selected, skip to step 9). Press `Continue`.

9. Select all of the relevant movie trailer frames which encompass your favourite scenes. Press `Continue`.

## Program Considerations

The program needs to have at least one movie trailer placed inside the folder `Movie-Trailers` to function properly.

At the moment, the program does not mitigate against incorrect user behaviour. Thus, the program may crash if it is incorrectly used.

## Program Output

After each successful program execution, ... (Need to update once I talk to Dr Cassidy)
